Ver 0.5
  * Fix bugs with buttons visual indications. Change logic so its not relaying on eventlistener.
  * Take out JS markup from html.
  * Refactor bubble sort code, so its not relying on noSwaps for checking if columns are sorted and it checks if sorted every step.
  * Refactor selection sort code the same way as bubble sort.
  * Refactor heap sort code. Add code that every step checks if array is sorted.
  * Refactor merge sort code. Take out checking if column array has more than 8 elements outside step function. Add code that every step checks if array is sorted.
